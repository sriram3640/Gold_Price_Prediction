# Gold_Price_Prediction
This project utilizes historical gold price data and the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to forecast future gold prices. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and R-squared. Customization options are available for exploring different algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical gold price data. It includes features such as date, opening price, closing price, high price, low price, and volume. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to remove any missing values or outliers.
